# Skills Used:
- Neo4j
- Cypher
- Knowledge Graph
- Docker
- Network Visualization

## Progress

- Status: Ongoing
  
- DONE:
  - Graph Database Initialization
  - Top 100 most potential Trustworthy / Fraudulent users based on average of given ratings [Naive Method]
  - Top 20 users with highest / lowest number of received ratings
  - Top 20 users who most / least frequently rate others
  - Overall Network Visualization
  - Community Detection
    - Modularity Optimization
    - Label Propagation
    - Louvain
  - Fairness & Goodness metrics for Feature Engineering
    
- TODO:
  - Community Visualization
  - Anomaly Detection in each user based on several features that fluctuate over time.
  - Usage of node embeddings + machine Learning models for fraud detection
